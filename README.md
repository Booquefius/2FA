## Information
2FA is a Spigot/Paper plugin, with BungeeCord support.
<br>It is a fork of [Connor Linfoot's MC2FA](https://github.com/ConnorLinfoot/MC2FA).

This plugin adds another layer of protection to your server, by allowing players to use 2FA with an Authenticator app,
<br>requiring them to enter a time-based generated code when loggin in/changing ips.

2FA uses BungeeCord PluginMessagingChannel to communicate between the Spigot Servers & BungeeCord server, therefore, if you want
<br>to use 2FA for BungeeCord, you need to put the jar file in /plugins/ for every Spigot server, as well as for your BungeeCord server.

## Features
* 2FA Authentication, based on permissions.
* Ability to remove own/other's 2FA
* BungeeCord support
* Json, MySQL, MongoDB support
* Admin commands

## Using Liel's 2FA
You can download 2FA from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2-factor-authentication-bungeecord-json-mysql-mongodb.85594/).
<br>After downloading, simply drug it into your plugins folder and reload the server!
<br>* If you use BungeeCord, install the plugin in your BungeeCord/plugins/ folder as well!
